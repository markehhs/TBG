# TBG
Text-based game written to demsontrate understanding of OOP principles and
other Java features. In this game you can:
- Attack and fight monsters
- Buy Item's and swap them in your inventory
- Utilize potion's to heal yourself 
- Level up (still in progress)
- Save/Load the game (little buggy)
- and more in progress!
TODO's
1. Save functionality is a little buggy with directories (maybe?)
2. Level up based on xp?
3. Spawn enemeis based on level?
4. Fix incorrect input when making choices (eg wrong weapon change)
